# Module Schema Notes

This folder contains module-specific schema notes for the team.
It is documentation only; migrations are the source of truth.

Use one file per module, for example:

- `users.md`
- `orders.md`

Include:
- Purpose of the module
- Key tables and relationships
- Invariants and constraints
- Migration references (e.g., `V1__...`)
